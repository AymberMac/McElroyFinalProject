The web map application Strange Encounters visualized the spatial distribution of reported UFO, Bigfoot and ghost sightings from around the world with interactive features to survey the details of each encounter. 
The Leaflet API supported this humorous interactive web-map project with a toggle that allowed single data layers and different basemap styles like satellite or street map preferences to be displayed independently. 
The Leaflet API was chosen for its superior code documentation, abundance of free basemap options, and open-source data friendly. The ability to toggle between diverse basemap options and utilize open-source datasets 
is extremely important for this mapping application, as well as the clear documentation that allows programmers to experiment with different plug-ins and API capabilities.
